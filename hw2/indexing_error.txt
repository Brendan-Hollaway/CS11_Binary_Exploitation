Since the code only checks that the number is less than 1000, it does not check whether the user input is negative or not. Thus, you can input a negative number to read data at a lower address than the array of prime numbers.

To read the global password variable, you should begin by inputting "-64". The last byte output will be the first character, the second to last byte the second character, etc. To get more than the first 4 letters of the password, you can then increase from e.g. -64 to -63, read the next 4 letters, and continue until the password is fully read in. For example, if the password is "password", then translating the hex output by -63 and then -64 would give you "drowssap", which, when taken in reverse order, gives you "password".
